# Computer Science Projects

This is the collection of further developed undergraduate assignments, combining courses from Introduction to Data Science (REI202G) and Analysis of Algorithms (TÖL403G) to Applied Linear Statistical Models (STÆ312M), Machine Learning (REI505M) and The AI Lifecycle (REI603M).

The classes mentioned are part of the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, specialising in Data Science, from the University of Iceland, to which I was enrolled in August 2022.
